# Requirements 

Blender 2.79 or any other 2.7 legacy version. The scripts will not work with more modern versions of Blender. However, another data set implementation known as [CLEVR-XAI](https://github.com/ahmedmagdiosman/clevr-xai) does not use legacy versions of Blender, which may be worth looking into to update the calls of this current replication.

The old implementation relied on Unix command calls. These were updated to be run on a Windows system.
